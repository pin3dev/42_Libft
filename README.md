# Libft - My very First Own Library

<aside>
<img src="https://www.notion.so/icons/checkmark_lightgray.svg" alt="https://www.notion.so/icons/checkmark_lightgray.svg" width="40px" /> This C project consists of creating a custom library containing functions that mimic the functionality of the standard C language libraries. The goal is to understand how the standard functions work, implement them, and learn how to use them. The project must be written in C according to established standards, including correct memory allocation and deallocation, and the use of a Makefile to compile the code.  The final goal is to create a complete library that can be used in future C projects.
