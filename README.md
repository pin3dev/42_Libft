This C project consists of creating a custom library containing functions that mimic the functionality of the standard C language libraries. The goal is to understand how the standard functions work, implement them, and learn how to use them. The project must be written in C according to established standards, including correct memory allocation and deallocation, and the use of a Makefile to compile the code.  The final goal is to create a complete library that can be used in future C projects.
